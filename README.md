**ASP.NET Core Web API**

This ASP.NET Core Web API is a backend solution designed to support two applications: a price checker application and a store management system. It uses the Entity Framework for efficient database operations, offering a streamlined implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions.

The API acts as a central data retrieval center, seamlessly integrating with the price checker application to provide real-time pricing data and the store application to manage product information and other retail operations. Its design emphasizes simplicity and performance, providing reliable and fast responses to front-end requests.

The application was created to support the <a href="https://github.com/ImJakubPuchala/WPF-App-For-Checking-Prices">application that checks prices.</a>. It also cooperates with the <a href="https://github.com/ImJakubPuchala/WPF-App-For-Shop">second application for shop.</a>
